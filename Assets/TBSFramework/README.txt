# Turn Based Strategy Framework v4.1.0

Turn Based Strategy Framework (TBSF) is a modular toolkit for building turn-based strategy games in Unity. It provides core systems needed for grid-based titles such as turn management, grid generation, unit behaviours, AI decision-making, and multiplayer support, letting developers focus on gameplay and customization rather than reinventing foundational mechanics. Comprehensive instructions and examples are maintained in the project documentation. 

## Overview

TBSF handles essential gameplay systems common to turn-based strategy games:

- Grid support for both square and hexagon layouts in 2D and 3D.
- Turn order and turn resolution logic.
- Units with movement, attack, abilities, and stats.
- AI powered by behavior trees with customizable decision logic.
- Optional online multiplayer integration.
- Unity-specific tooling and sample scenes to accelerate setup.

## Structure

Documentation covers:

- Getting started and installation.
- Scene setup, grid and unit concepts.
- Customization of cells, units, abilities, and visuals.
- AI and game state management.
- Online multiplayer architecture and setup.
